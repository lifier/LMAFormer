# Abstract
<p align="justify">
In temporal infrared small target detection, it is crucial to leverage the disparities in spatio-temporal characteristics between the target and the background to distinguish the former. However, remote imaging and the relative motion between the detection platform and the background cause significant coupling of spatio-temporal characteristics, making target detection highly challenging. To address these challenges, we propose a network named LMAFormer. First, we introduce a local motion-aware spatio-temporal attention mechanism that leverages motion and temporal energy variations between infrared small targets and backgrounds to extract locally salient spatio-temporal features of targets. Second, we employ a multi-scale fusion transformer encoder that computes self-attention weights across and within scales during encoding, acquiring multi-scale global spatio-temporal information for enhanced motion background modeling. Lastly, we propose a multi-frame joint query decoder. The shallowest feature map after multi-scale feature propagation is mapped to initial query weights, which are refined through grouped convolutions to generate grouped query vectors. These are jointly optimized to encapsulate rich multi-frame details, strengthening motion background modeling and target feature representation, improving prediction accuracy. Experimental results on the NUDT-MIRSDT, IRDST and the established TSIRMT datasets demonstrate that our network outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

# Installation


## Environment Setup
The experiments were done on Windows11 with python 3 using anaconda environment. Here is details on how to set up the conda environment.
(If you do not have anaconda 3 installed, first do it following the set up instruction from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)) 

* Create conda environment:
 
  ```create environment
  conda create -n LMAFormer python=3
  conda activate LMAFormer
  ```

* Install PyTorch from [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). 

* Install MultiScaleDeformableAttention module:
  ```setup
  python ./MFIRSTD/models/ops/setup.py install
  
* Install other requirements:

  ```setup
  pip install -r requirements.txt

## Datasets
We evaluate network performance using NUDR-MIRSDT, IRDST and a self-built dataset TSIRMT

Download the datasets following the corresponding paper/project page and update dataset paths in 'datasets/path_config.py'. 
Here is the list of datasets used. 

- [NUDT-MIRSDT](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1pSN350eurMafLiHBQBnrPA?pwd=5whn) (Extraction code: 5whn)
- [IRDST](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sb-32pydlpXvlNxwx9niT2t6KP9oMJID/view?usp=sharing)
- [TSIRMT](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aWDNdUWkTOuV3fILbgLDEqM2N2erW05n?usp=sharing)

The NUDT-MIRSDT dataset requires the 'rearrange_dataset.py' program for path reconstruction, with 'rearrange_dataset.py' located at '/Datasets/rearrange_dataset.py'.
The dataset division is subject to the method in the Datasets folder.
## Download Trained Models 
Pretrained Swin backbones can be downloaded from their corresponding repository. 
- [Swin-S](https://github.com/SwinTransformer/storage/releases/download/v1.0.4/swin_small_patch244_window877_kinetics400_1k.pth)
- [Swin-B](https://github.com/SwinTransformer/storage/releases/download/v1.0.4/swin_base_patch244_window877_kinetics400_22k.pth)
- [Resnet-101 COCO](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NGuaew1d0x0kdK2XR_J3Vlmc6OGtOe58/view?usp=sharing)
